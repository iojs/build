# io.js Build CentOS 6 Setup

For setting up a CentOS 6 box

```text
Host test-softlayer-centos6-x64-1
  HostName 50.23.85.251
  User root
Host test-softlayer-centos6-x64-2
  HostName 184.173.120.137
  User root
Host release-softlayer-centos6-x64-1
  HostName 50.97.245.10
  User root
Host release-digitalocean-centos6-x86-1
  HostName 162.243.248.28
  User root
```

Note that these hostnames are also used in the *ansible-inventory* file. The IP addresses will need to be updated each time the servers are reprovisioned.

To set up a host, run:

```text
$ ansible-playbook -i ../ansible-inventory ansible-playbook.yaml
```

Start-up of the Jenkins slaves is manual (for now), run:

```text
$ ssh iojs-build-centos6-1 -l iojs ./start.sh
```

**Users**: The ansible-vars.yaml file contains a list of users who's GitHub public keys are pulled and placed into authorized_keys for both root and iojs users. This file should be updates when new users are added to the build project who are able to help maintain the containerized builds.
