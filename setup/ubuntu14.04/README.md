# io.js Build Ubuntu 14.04 Setup

For setting up a Ubuntu 14.04 box

```text
Host iojs-build-ubuntu1404-64-1
  HostName 104.236.74.49
  User root
Host iojs-build-ubuntu1404-32-1
  HostName 104.236.77.78
  User root
Host iojs-ibm-ppcle-ubuntu1404-64-1
  HostName 140.211.168.171
  User root
Host iojs-ibm-ppcle-ubuntu1404-64-2
  HostName 140.211.168.192
  User root
Host iojs-softlayer-benchmark
  HostName 50.23.85.254
  User root
Host iojs-ibm-ppcle-ubuntu1404-release-64-1
  HostName 140.211.168.193
  User root
```

Note that these hostnames are also used in the *ansible-inventory* file. The IP addresses will need to be updated each time the servers are reprovisioned.

To set up a host, run:

```text
$ ansible-playbook -i ../ansible-inventory ansible-playbook.yaml
```

Start-up of the Jenkins slaves is manual (for now), run:

```text
$ ssh iojs-build-ubuntu1404-64-1 -l iojs ./start.sh
$ ssh iojs-build-ubuntu1404-32-1 -l iojs ./start.sh
``` 

**Users**: The ansible-vars.yaml file contains a list of users who's GitHub public keys are pulled and placed into authorized_keys for both root and iojs users. This file should be updates when new users are added to the build project who are able to help maintain the containerized builds.
