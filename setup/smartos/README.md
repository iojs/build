# io.js Build SmartOS Setup

To set up hosts, make sure you add them to your ssh config first:
```
Host iojs-build-smartos-64-1
  HostName 165.225.137.91
  User root

Host iojs-build-smartos-32-1
  HostName 165.225.138.254
  User root
```

Note that these hostnames are also used in the ansible-inventory file.
The IP addresses will need to be updated each time the servers
are reprovisioned.

To set up a host, run:

```text
$ ansible-playbook -i ../ansible-inventory ansible-playbook.yaml
```

**Users**: The ansible-vars.yaml file contains a list of users who's GitHub
public keys are pulled and placed into authorized_keys for both root and
iojs users. This file should be updates when new users are added to the
build project who are able to help maintain the containerized builds.
