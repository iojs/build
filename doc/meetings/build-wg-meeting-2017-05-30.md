* No objections. Welcome Michele.

### Make regular canary builds with V8 lkgr [#626](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/626)
* Any objections? No.
* Need suggestion for naming in nodejs.org/download.  @ofrobots joined,
  so asked him for suggestion.  Suggested v8canary. @rvagg volunteered to
  do updates required to add.  A bit more complicated due to the new naming in
  the download structure.  So might take a bit longer.

* Node.js infrastructure sponsor logo/language,
* Official twitter account on an internal , Michael to talk to
  Tracy to see what we can do on these 2 fronts.

* Rod: We should do blog posts on things the build WG are
  doing, and we could mention the sponsors in there.
* Rod created https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/741 to collect ideas

### downloads/cloudflare
