### nodejs/build

### When adding new targets, can we ensure they work on all release lines [#1182](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1182)
* Gibson: Would be good to document "what to check" going forward.
* Rod: We should work out what to do here, when something fails. Do we skip on
  other release lines?
* Gibson: Okay with skipping as long as we leave an issue open to fix flaky
  tests and unskip, otherwise we'll never unskip.
* Gibson: We can continue discussion in issue, but would be good to agree on a
  plan with releasers.

### Updating admin lists [#1107](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1107)
* Rod: My suggestion is to split out jenkins out for test and release, then give
  broader access.
* Rod: Just needs adding a new team and then changing the ci matrix
* Gibson: I’ll raise an issue for it later, just need to make sure that existing
  admins can still access ci-release.
### New OSX infra walkthrough [#1026](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/1026)
* Michael: I can give a quick overview, though I won’t be able to 
* Michael: Docs are available in secrets/build/infra/macstadium.md
* Rod: I recall that you have to add a new host first before you can get Vsphere
  access for it.
* Rod: Shall we table this until the next meeting?
* All: No objections

## Q&A, Other

* Gibson: FYI I’ve been seeing SSL certificate errors with the git we have one
  some internal RHEL 6 machines, something to watch out for.
* Rod: I had to build git from source on CentOS 5, I’m working on an ansible
  script for it.
