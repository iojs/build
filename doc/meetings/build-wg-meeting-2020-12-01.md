## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **build-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

* Ash - Node.js Orka cloud will do down on Dec 10th

### nodejs/build

* Apple silicon builds [#2474](https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2474)
  * Still need to get DTKs working again, after OSX update
  * MacStadium do have M1â€™s but they have high demand, so will get some but likely a bit later
  * Translation layer seems to work, so existing binaries seem to work ok on ARM
  * For building natively only 15.x or higher works
  * Targeting 16.x to do build fat binaries
  * Rod has PR into gyp-next, disables some flags that are used for compiling
  * Michael mentioned - https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/2474#issuecomment-735446869
     * Current thought is to rely on MacStadium to start then once things settle out a bit more
       potentially look at some redundancy through physical machines

* Ash
  * Making some good progress on the Metrics side. Have something that worked running over
    the weekend.
