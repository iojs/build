Github bot is currently not working. There is an issue with the dependencies. It will require some manual work as not everything can be done via the current Ansible scripts. Note that this is a legacy service (Node@14). https://github.com/nodejs/build/issues/3720
Code static analysis is broken and we have an alternative in place
We needed to update the Python version on the release machines due the new version of gyp-next.
